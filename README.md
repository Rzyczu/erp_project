## Detailed Functionality of `erp_app`

The `erp_app` is a core module of the ERP system, responsible for managing various aspects of business processes. Below is a detailed description of the application's functionality:

### Main Components

- **Models (`models.py`)**:
  - Define the structure of the data stored in the database. This may include models related to user management, products, invoices, orders, and other key business entities.
  - Models are the basis for automatic form generation and the admin panel.

- **Views (`views.py`)**:
  - Handle the application's logic, processing HTTP requests and passing data to templates.
  - Example views include:
    - Displaying lists of products, customers, orders.
    - Detailed views of individual entities, such as order details.
    - Handling the creation and editing of data through forms.

- **Forms (`forms.py`)**:
  - Contain Django forms for validating and processing user-input data.
  - Enable the creation, editing, and deletion of records such as products, customers, or orders.

- **Decorators (`decorators.py`)**:
  - Custom decorator functions that can restrict access to certain resources based on user roles (e.g., admin, staff).
  - Allow for easy addition of authorization logic to views.

- **Context Processors (`context_processors.py`)**:
  - Functions that add global variables to the template context, making them available in every view.
  - Useful for adding data like global app settings or dynamic menu elements.

- **Admin Panel (`admin.py`)**:
  - Registers models with Django's admin panel, enabling data management directly from the admin interface.
  - May include custom configurations such as displaying additional columns or filtering data.

### URL Structure (`urls.py`)

- Maps various views to URLs, allowing for navigation through the application.
- Supports creating user-friendly URLs for specific features, such as viewing order lists or editing products.

### Templates (`templates/`)

- Contain HTML files rendered by views.
- Used to display data attractively and provide the user interface for different features.
- Example templates include product lists, order forms, and reports.

### Custom Template Tags (`templatetags/`)

- Extend Django templates' capabilities by adding new tags or filters.
- Useful for processing data directly in templates, allowing for better control over data presentation.

### Migrations (`migrations/`)

- Store database migration files that are generated automatically as models change.
- Enable easy management of database schema changes and are an integral part of managing the application's data.

### Tests (`tests.py`)

- Contains unit tests for the application, ensuring that each functionality works as expected.
- Tests may include validation of forms, views, and model functions.

## Key Functionalities of `erp_app`

- **User Management**: Create and edit users, assign roles and permissions.
- **Product and Inventory Management**: Add, edit, and track products, control stock levels.
- **Order Handling**: Create orders, assign to customers, update order status.
- **Invoicing and Payments**: Generate invoices, manage payments and settlements.
- **Report Generation**: Create reports based on data, such as sales, inventory levels, or financials.
